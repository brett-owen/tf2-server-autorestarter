# TF2 Server Autorestarter

This plugin restarts a tf2 server every `sm_autorestarter_timer` seconds, default is 3600 seconds or 60 minutes. This restart only happens if the server is empty.

To enable the plugin, put `sm_autorestarter_enabled "1"` in your server.cfg

The plugin also restarts the server 60 seconds after all players have left the server.

Keep your servers fresh! Restart them often.
